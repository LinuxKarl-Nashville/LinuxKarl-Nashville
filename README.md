# LinuxKarl, from Nashville, TN, USA
Hello there visitor! Welcome, and thank you for your visit!
#### UNDER CONSTRUCTION

My name is Karl Haines, and I've been living in Nashville, TN for over 35 years (90% of my life). I am not a fan of country music, but I do
absolutely love my city! I've been working with computers in one way or another (professionally) for 25+ years. I started experimenting with
programming in 1995, using Pascal. I began using Linux (Slackware) at the age of 14 (this was in 1996). Since then I have mastered many and
more programming languages, operating systems, hardware architechtures, and "new technologies" of great value and crap value alike. I have
literally been involved with the PC sceen from the addition of a math-coprocessor to a 25Mhz processor (from sx to dx), all way through the
introdution of the internet to the general public on a 14.4 modem, to ISDN, DSL, then T1, and on and on. I watched the dotcom bubble blow up
and explode.

My years of expderience along with the wisdom I've gained from living through all of these events have made me into and individual with
complete confidence where almost any technology problem needs to be engineered. I say this with confidence but with humility that only
comes from years of life lived and lessons learned.

## Technology Specializations
Like everyone, I do have certain areas of expertise that make me an individual and either more or less vauluable to an employer or client
based on their needs. I will attempt to detail below most of the technologies that I have extreme confidence in.
